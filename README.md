# TowerDefense
A tower defense game that I followed along with a tutorial to create. It features 3 different turrets, a rocket launcher, a regular turret, and a lazer turret.  
  
You are able to upgrade the turrets by selecting them, and given you have enough money for it, upgrade them. The regular turret shoots faster and does more damage when it is upgraded. The missile launcher has a larger targeting radius and it has a larger explosion. The lazer turret, when upgraded, shoots an ice beam that slows the enemies and the lazer itself inflicts more damage.  
There are 3 different types of enemies, simple enemies, fast enemies, and tough enemies. The simple enemies are average speed with average health. The fast enemies are fast but weak. The tough enemies are slower but have a lot more health.  
  
The game has a main menu where you can choose to play which brings you to a level select menu. You can then select the level you would like to play. (Currently only level 1 is intended for people to play, level 2 is a test environment.)
